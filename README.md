# current-python-works-and-projects
projects for personal use and developing my python skills

Webstatus.py mainly just to learn some tkinter

filetransfer exe for personal use me and my brother often want to send files a bit large for discord but only like 50mb, so a personal project while learning
some socket basics and more tkinter


Currently working on the nutrition project, uses the USDA 2015 nutritional database and displays the data can select catagory,
for personal use aswell as nutriional labels hardly tell you anything and marketing is misleading, googling is also usually misleading or based on health trends
rather then the actual numbers,
want to add in recommendations and/or a search bar to add your items to a listto give you a calculation of your nutritional intake,
recomandations based on your deficits would be nice
Lots more work needed
